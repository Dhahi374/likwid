Branch misprediction ratio  PMC1/PMC0

LONG
Formulas:
Branch misprediction ratio = BR_INST_MISSP_EXEC / BR_INST_EXEC
-
The rates state how often in average a branch or a mispredicted branch occured
per instruction retired in total. The Branch misprediction ratio sets directly
into relation what ratio of all branch instruction where mispredicted.
